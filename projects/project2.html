                        Ferdinand Unstoppabull was the first commercial game project I worked on from start to finish. The game was based on the animated family film Ferdinand by Blue Sky Studios. We collaborated with 20th Century Fox's games division to align on brand presentation and sync the release with the film's commercial launch—both of which we succeeded in.
                    </p><p>
                        As the sole designer on the project, I handled systems design, UX design, and economy design. I also programmed and animated UI elements to polish the game's look and feel.

                            The game uniquely blended match-3 gameplay with idle and incremental mechanics, systems, and economy. The presentation revolved around a scene from the Ferdinand movie where bulls compete against horses in a dance-off. In the game, the kind-hearted Ferdinand wants to spread the joy of dancing to everyone.

                            Looking back after 10 years, I believe the game would have benefited from tighter, simpler design. I'm also not sure if this genre mix could work as a commercially viable free-to-play product. Still, I'm very proud of what we accomplished on a tight schedule with such a junior team, and I learned a lot about all aspects of developing a game from start to finish.
