                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        I joined Kuuhubb as the second member of a new game development team. I conducted market analysis and pitched game concepts to management. We decided to pursue a match-3 game with meta progression built around interactive stories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Team Lead and Lead Game Designer, I built a team of roughly ten people. We developed and released the game, then made significant retention improvements through post-launch updates based on live data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I designed all the game's systems and core loop, collaborated closely on UX and story creation, and programmed the dynamic difficulty system for the match-3 levels.

                            After the first launch, we noticed players were dropping off during story sections. We decided to revamp the stories to be snappier and include just one choice per sequence—but that choice should always feel meaningful from the player's perspective. That story update—which also added a simple new progression layer—nearly doubled our retention.

                            Ultimately, the slow production speed of story content became a major bottleneck for expanding the game. This taught me a valuable lesson for future projects—especially games designed for years of updates. In today's market, it's crucial to be strategic about what content you provide and how you deliver it. This allows you to manage live games more efficiently.
