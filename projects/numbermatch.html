                        Number Crossing had an extremely tight schedule: 2 months from start to test release, and a very small development team that consisted of me, a programmer, and two artists who could only contribute part-time. We targeted the "number match" puzzle category and managed to build and release the game on time despite limited resources and schedule constraints.

                        During the project, I created a new design workflow. I validated and tested design ideas by first building rough playable prototypes with AI tools, then testing them with external playtesters to identify potential issues in the design or UX, and I kept iterating the design using this loop. This had a tremendous effect on our small team's development speed. I could iterate on the design extremely fast while other team members worked on already locked designs. The approach was especially impactful because we wanted to try a new take on the number match genre, which required lots of of design exploration and experimentation. We also used many existing elements from a live product to speed up development.

                            Unfortunately, the game didn't meet our KPI goals. I believe we made it too casual for the genre's existing fans, but the way we added depth through a "score bar" wasn't immediately clear to players. Still, I'm glad we failed fast and learned quickly. We pivoted to a more traditional number match experience, which immediately showed significantly better performance.
