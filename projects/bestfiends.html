                        Best Fiends is a casual puzzle RPG where you build a team of Fiends to fight evil Slugs as you progress through the world of Minutia. The game has been downloaded over 100 million times and has generated hundreds of millions in revenue to date. I joined the team as a Senior Game Designer and was later promoted to Product Owner due to my deep involvement across projects I worked on.

                            I worked simultaneously on two recurring limited-time features for Best Fiends: Season Pass and Tournament of Champions.<br><br>

                            With Season Pass our goal was to increase both the daily engagement and spending of active players, both in which the feature succeeded in. We faced some challenges with the complexity of the dynamic economy systems we built for the feature, and looking back at it now I think the feature development and its product performance would have both benefitted from simpler design.
                            <br><br>
                            Tournament of Champions introduced a competitive event that matchmade players of similar levels to compete through elimination rounds. Winners earned unique prizes, such as new visual styles for their Fiends. The feature consistently drove significant revenue and engagement spikes when active.
